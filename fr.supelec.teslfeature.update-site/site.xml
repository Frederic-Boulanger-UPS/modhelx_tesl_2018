      The Tagged Event Specification Language allows the specification
of timed systems by modeling events as clocks and occurrences
of an event as ticks on its clock.
Both event-triggered and time-triggered models are supported
through the use of implication relations between clocks and of
relations between the time scale of the clocks.
