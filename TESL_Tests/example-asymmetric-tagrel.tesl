// the tick at 2 on master1 occurs at date 4 on master2
// the tick at 5 on master2 occurs at date 2 on master1
// If the tag reference is master1, we cannot distinguish dates 4 and 5 of master2
// because they both correspond to date 2 on master1
// If the tag reference is master2, we have a finer time scale which allows us to 
// distinguish dates 4 and 5 of master2, although they still correspond to the same 
// date 2 on master1. The VCDs are not the same when we change the reference time scale.
