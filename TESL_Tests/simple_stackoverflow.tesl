int-clock event sporadic 7

unit-clock enter1
unit-clock enter2

int-clock start sporadic 0
tag relation start = event
start implies enter1

int-clock eventPrime
tag relation eventPrime = event
event implies eventPrime
enter1 time delayed by 2 on eventPrime implies enter2

enter2 when event implies enter1   // generates a stack overflow
// The stack overflow does not occur if the clock "eventPrime" does not exist
// and "event" is used instead.
// *** FIXED ***
