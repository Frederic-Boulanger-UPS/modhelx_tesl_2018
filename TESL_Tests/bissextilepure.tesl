// Computing leap years with "pure" clocks and filtering

int-clock year periodic 1

unit-clock year4
year filtered by 0,1 (3,1)* implies year4

unit-clock year100
year filtered by 0,1 (99,1)* implies year100

unit-clock year400
year filtered by 0,1 (399,1)* implies year400

unit-clock leap
// A year is leap if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100
year4 sustained immediately from year4 to year100 weakly implies leap
// However, a year divisible by 400 is leap
year400 implies leap
