// Computing leap years with periodic clocks and tag relations

int-clock year periodic 1

int-clock year4 periodic 4
tag relation year4 = year

int-clock year100 periodic 100
tag relation year100 = year

int-clock year400 periodic 400
tag relation year400 = year

unit-clock leap
// A year is leap if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100
year4 when not year100 implies leap
// However, a year divisible by 400 is leap
year400 implies leap
