float-clock A
float-clock B
float-clock C sporadic 32.5

unit-clock Err sporadic 2.3

int-clock D periodic 4
float-clock E sporadic 3, 8, 10
unit-clock F
int-clock G periodic 4 offset 2

A implies F

D time delayed by 1.5 on D implies G
D time delayed by 2 on Err implies G

B filtered by 4,5 (7, 8)* implies D

A sustained immediately from B to D weakly implies F
A sustained immediately from B to D implies F
A sustained from B to D weakly implies F
A sustained from B to D implies F

A immediately delayed by 4 on B implies F
A delayed by 4 on B implies F

tag relation A = 4*B+2
tag relation A = 3 * B+4
